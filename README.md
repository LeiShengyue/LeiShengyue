- 👋 Hi, I’m @LeiShengyue, a graduate student at TMDU.
- 🧑‍🔬 I'm currently studying Oncology in the Division of Experimental Pathology at the Cancer Institute, JFCR, and exploring how aneuploidy 🧬 affects tumor formation and progression using scRNA-seq and scAmplicon-seq(maybe also scDNA-seq and WGS in the future).
- 🌱 Learning bioinformatics, particularly focusing on single-cell analysis.
